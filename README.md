Regular Expressions are an artform.

## TL; DR

This app lets you test your Regular Expressions locally.

## What the?

I wanted to make a small project that used Ruby 1.9's [Oniguruma] regular
expression engine.

## Install

Ruby 1.9.2+ users can simply:

<pre><code>
[sudo] gem install graffiti
</code></pre>

sudo is optional (and you shouldn't anyway)

Sorry folks, Ruby 1.8.7 is not supported right now (patches are accepted!),
but you can install the oniguruma gem if you want to mess with
Regular Expressions using this engine.

## Dependencies

* Ruby 1.9.2-p0 or newer

## Usage

Simply type:

<pre><code>
graffiti
</code></pre>

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and
start messing with Regular Expressions.

## Contribute

I love the github pull request system and so will you when contributing!

* Fork the repo
* Make a patch (with tests please!)
* Send a pull request

Simple! If you need stuff to work on, check the "Issues" section of the
github repo.  If its a new feature, make it awesome and I'll gladly accept
the patch.
