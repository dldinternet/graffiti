Regular Expressions are an artform.

## TL; DR

This app lets you test your Regular Expressions locally on a web page.

## What the?

Regular Expressions are the universal search language that crosses
all language boundries. Most text editors, modern languages and
even web sites support Regular Expressions.  Graffiti is intended
to be a teaching aid and utility to help developers master this
artform.

## Install

Simply type:

<pre><code>
[sudo] gem install graffiti
</code></pre>

sudo is optional (and you shouldn't anyway, especially if you use RVM)

## Dependencies

For advanced regex (Assertions, POSIX, etc) you'll need Ruby 1.9 or JRuby

Advanced stuff on Rubinius/MRI 1.8.7 is coming in another version

## Usage

Simply type:

<pre><code>
graffiti
</code></pre>

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and
start messing with Regular Expressions.

You can find some customization options by passing the -h option like so:

<pre><code>
graffiti -h
</code></pre>

Simple! If you need stuff to work on, check the "Issues" section of the

## Wish List

I wanted to get this project out there and into everyone's hands
so I get ideas on where to take this project.
